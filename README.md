## Introduction
Tokenization service.

### Running on native machine
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run the application in development mode with `npm run dev`
3. Access `https://localhost:4000/api` and you're ready to go!

## Scripts
This boilerplate comes with a collection of npm scripts to make your life easier, you'll run them with `npm run <script name>`:
- `dev`: Run the application in development mode
- `start` Run the application in production mode (prefer not to do that in development)
- `test`: Run the test suite
- `test:unit`: Run only the unit tests
